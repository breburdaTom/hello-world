Hi,

I am currently in pursuit of learning how to code and slowly discovering the world of ~~programming and programmers~~ software development and developers.

  The line above was written almost 2 years ago. I failed horribly. That was probably my second attempt how to get into the world of ~~programming~~ SW development. The first one was I think when I was around 10 years old. But since I was a dumb kid without any proper guidance, one massive 900 page book about HTML (I know HTML is not real programming language) written in the most technical language didn't do the job. Neither did some intro to coding on elementary school where after 15 minutes of first lesson everybody started playing https://www.bulanci.cz/ on LAN.

Then on High School (the kind which we call 'Gymn√°zium' in Czech Republic) we had some basic ICT classes (== MS office package) and Computer graphic design classes - IN ZONER CALISTO!!! (wtf).

So the formal education system I was in was not very helpful. 

Then we got to the time 2 years ago I already mentioned - my second attempt. Well, it didn't go to well. I did some short interactive tutorials online. Did not understand much the meaning of anything. ...aaand it somehow faded away.


The year is **2019**, the month is October, last week of it.
My friend shares an article with me about how you can learn to code and get employed within few months. On your own. For free. With every resource and time-plan layed out for you. (This one was mainly focused on **Web-Development** - so the holy trinity of **HTML, CSS and Javascript**). This got me so hyped up!

*Back to 2020*

Since then I am studying every day for at least an hour. Some days it is even 4 hours. It completely opened up the world of computer science and technology to me - from the inside. I mean, I was always interested in computers, but never tried to understand them more than how can I crack this PC game that I didn't pay for.... (...I know).

I chose to stay in the beginning with the WebDevelopment field since as per my opinion is the easiest entry gate to the broader field. And I hope even someone as stupid as me can learn at least this thing.

But my vision is that in 10 years I will understand and can put to use skills of AI systems, automation, data science, [enter your favorite buzz-word]. So if things go well I will not end just with JavaScript, hopefully.

This readme article and this whole gitHub profile should document my journey how I started from ZERO knowledge and where did I end up with all the fails and terrible repositories along the way. 

I hope it will look better in the next 2 years. Let's see.

Ok so in July last year I started working as a Test Automation engineer / QA SW tester. The knowledge gained from the WebDevelopment learning sprint helped me to pass the interview, nice. I am no Web Developer, and currently at work I use a bit of basic Java code, but it's rather a combination of copying old code, adjusting it, and then plenty of other technologies used for SW testing that build up the whole job tasks package. I am lucky as the whole framework was built up by my predecesors, I couldn't create in on my own. But in current state I am able to operate within it on daily basis even when my predecesors already left the team.

What's great is that currently I almost finished a 3 month long online academy about Linux Systems administration - and I love it. I am writing these lines about a month before my certification exam. It's not really hard, but there is a lot of different subtopics and lot of stuff is interconnected and that makes it pretty challenging to learn. I definitely have to do some serious study time before I go to take the exam, phew...

When I started with the academy I merely thought I will only expand my general IT skillset and maybe it could help me in few years, but right now I am really liking it and would like to start working as a Linux Admin if I manage to pass the certification. We will see.
